# Result and Analysis:

We studied the 'Cross-disciplinary evolution of the genomics revolution' in this project. We *adopted* the analysis slightly and implemented the code by ourselves. See below for summary:

# Project guidelines

## [Posted on: Wednesday, February 13, 2019 12:03:11 PM CST]

Hi Stat Methods Class,

Regarding the project for this course, as I mentioned in class, we will try to reproduce the analysis in the paper:

Petersen, A.M., Majeti, D., Kwon, K., Ahmed, M.E. and Pavlidis, I., 2018. Cross-disciplinary evolution of the genomics revolution. Science Advances, 4(8), p.eaat4211.

We will split the work in three parts:

1) In February we will tackle the exploratory analysis, synopsized by Figure 3 and Figure 2 in the paper.

2) In March, we will tackle the cross-sectional analysis, synopsized  by Figure 4 in the paper.

3) In April, we will tackle the panel analysis, synopsized by Figure 5 in the paper.

Please start working with this general outline in mind. Every week we will give you more information and answer questions. Please also plan to submit formal reports at the end of each month, covering the deliverables for the said month.

Best regards,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis

Hi class,

As I told you last Friday, this week you need to work towards the visualization of the social network in the Science Advances paper. In this respect, I suggested that you do Figure 2 in the said paper, as well as Figure S3 in the paper's supplementary material. Although this week nothing is formally due project-wise, I encourage you to follow my suggestions and work accordingly to avoid excessive load when this becomes due. I also encourage you to volunteer showing to the class and me what you have done and if you faced any problems. I will provide time for one or two such presentations half-way through the class time on Friday.

Next week, we will be wrapping up the exploratory analysis of the project, and you will need to do Figure S1, S2, and S4 from the supplement. You will also need to embellish these figures in a report, where you will briefly describe your findings. This report will be due on March 1 and will be graded. It will account for 1/3 of the project's grade. As I said a few weeks back, we will split the course project tin three parts, to help you make regular progress.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis

Dear class,

As we are moving towards the extended deadline for the exploratory analysis part of your course project, I would like to list all the figures that you need to construct from the Science Advances paper:

Figure 2 & Figure 3 form the main text

Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S3, and Figure S4 from the supplement

The extended deadline is March 8, 2019. Please note that there will be no further extensions. Hence, I encourage you to not let the project work for the last moment. A couple of these figures need thought, effort, and time.

In your submission on March 8, you need to have a cover page with the names of the people in the team and a short description of how each member contributed to this phase of the project. Then, you should have the figures produced by the R code (except the network figures) and an extended caption for each figure. Captions should describe the  figure content and also include interesting observations, conclusions, and hypotheses. The annotated code should also be uploaded as a separate attachment.

Tomorrow, we will have one more opportunity to discuss project issues in class. Volunteer to show your progress and your problems, so that we can provide feedback or initiate double checking for catching possible errors/omissions.

Thank you,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis

Hi Class,

I hope you all had a nice spring break. As I mentioned in the class just before the break, you need to work towards your next project milestone, which is the cross-sectional model in the Science Advances paper. This model is a multi-regression model with some control factors, which looks at the totality of the faculty records trying to explain their success. Success is defined as the total citation impact. The model is given in Eq. (1) in the paper.

You will need to produce Fig. 4 in the main text. You will also need to produce Table S2 and Table S3 in the paper's supplementary material.

The submission deadline for this project milestone is April 5, 2019 at 4 pm.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Best regards,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis

Good morning all,

As I said in class on Friday, the last project milestone is about panel modeling. You need to produce Figure 5 from the main text and Tables S4, S5, and S6 from the Supplementary Materials of the Science Advances paper. As usual, submissions should come complete with the R code, short descriptions of methods and results, as well as interpretations and other thoughts. Project reports are due on May 2, as the syllabus indicates. In subsequent classes, I will keep devoting some time to provide further insights into panel modeling and answer any questions that may arise. I strongly recommend that you start working on this right away, as it is more involved than cross-sectional modeling.

Best regards,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis

Hi all,

In response to a question I received on Friday regarding the number of XD publications, here is the answer:

The paper reports at some point the total number of XD publications, which is over 4,200. However, some of you found the number to be a little under 4,000. The reason is that we provided in the public repository only the filtered data. In these filtered data we excluded XD publications belonging to authors who are not part of the giant network component. Analysis on such poorly connected authors is not very meaningful (remember, there are variables related to centrality etc, which in the case of authors not belonging to the giant component are ill defined).

So, it is ok that you have found a little less than 4,000 XD publications instead of a little over 4,000 - this directly relates to the filtered subset we provided. In any case, either you use the filtered data or the full data (if you had them) will not change the significance of the results. The effect is not only ill defined, it is also very small by any measure.

Thank you,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis
