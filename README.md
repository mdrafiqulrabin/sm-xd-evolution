Hi Stat Methods Class,

Regarding the project for this course, as I mentioned in class, we will try to reproduce the analysis in the paper:

Petersen, A.M., Majeti, D., Kwon, K., Ahmed, M.E. and Pavlidis, I., 2018. Cross-disciplinary evolution of the genomics revolution. Science Advances, 4(8), p.eaat4211.

We will split the work in three parts:

1) In February we will tackle the exploratory analysis, synopsized by Figure 3 and Figure 2 in the paper.

2) In March, we will tackle the cross-sectional analysis, synopsized  by Figure 4 in the paper.

3) In April, we will tackle the panel analysis, synopsized by Figure 5 in the paper.

Please start working with this general outline in mind. Every week we will give you more information and answer questions. Please also plan to submit formal reports at the end of each month, covering the deliverables for the said month.

Best regards,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis

Hi class,

As I told you last Friday, this week you need to work towards the visualization of the social network in the Science Advances paper. In this respect, I suggested that you do Figure 2 in the said paper, as well as Figure S3 in the paper's supplementary material. Although this week nothing is formally due project-wise, I encourage you to follow my suggestions and work accordingly to avoid excessive load when this becomes due. I also encourage you to volunteer showing to the class and me what you have done and if you faced any problems. I will provide time for one or two such presentations half-way through the class time on Friday.

Next week, we will be wrapping up the exploratory analysis of the project, and you will need to do Figure S1, S2, and S4 from the supplement. You will also need to embellish these figures in a report, where you will briefly describe your findings. This report will be due on March 1 and will be graded. It will account for 1/3 of the project's grade. As I said a few weeks back, we will split the course project tin three parts, to help you make regular progress.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis
