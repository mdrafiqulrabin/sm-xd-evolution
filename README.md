Hi Stat Methods Class,

Regarding the project for this course, as I mentioned in class, we will try to reproduce the analysis in the paper:

Petersen, A.M., Majeti, D., Kwon, K., Ahmed, M.E. and Pavlidis, I., 2018. Cross-disciplinary evolution of the genomics revolution. Science Advances, 4(8), p.eaat4211.

We will split the work in three parts:

1) In February we will tackle the exploratory analysis, synopsized by Figure 3 and Figure 2 in the paper.

2) In March, we will tackle the cross-sectional analysis, synopsized  by Figure 4 in the paper.

3) In April, we will tackle the panel analysis, synopsized by Figure 5 in the paper.

Please start working with this general outline in mind. Every week we will give you more information and answer questions. Please also plan to submit formal reports at the end of each month, covering the deliverables for the said month.

Best regards,

Ioannis Thomas Pavlidis
